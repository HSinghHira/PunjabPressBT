We have spent a very long time developing this theme and the framework which it is built upon. We've done our very best to make it as expensive and feature-rich as possible, while also keeping it incredibly easy and slick to use. We've also worked hard to improve the ease of customisation, and have provided a Documentation reference for anyone who wishes to extend/modify & understand the theme and its Scripts. I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this theme. I'll do my best to assist you. If you have any more general question relating to this themes, you might consider visiting the forums and asking your question.
